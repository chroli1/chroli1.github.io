What is a synthetic dimension?
------------------------------

Synthetic dimensions are a fairly new technique for implementing theoretical models in experiment, usually ultracold atoms and photonics. The idea is a to take some physical system that supports a set of states, and to somehow perturb the system such that the states get coupled together. We can the re-interpret the system moving between these states as a particle hopping along a synthetic lattice.

Doing this might make it easier to engineer models that are theoretically interesting in the lab than with other methods. It could also be used to explore new fundamental physics that can't be accessed in experiment by usual methods, like higher-dimensional models.

Synthetic dimensions were first suggested in 2014, and lots of other approaches have been proposed and realised in experiment since then. I work on two different approaches, one in ultracold atoms and one in photonics.
