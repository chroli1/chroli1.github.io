I am a PhD student at the University of Birmingham, currently working in the group of Dr. Hannah Price. I am working on synthetic dimension schemes in ultracold atoms and photonics and exploring the exciting things we can do with these. I set up this site as a home for my PhD and science endeavours. You can read in more detail about my research and see some talks and posters I've presented at conferences. You can also read about my outreach work and see a short CV. I might also have a go at writing a blog - we'll see!
